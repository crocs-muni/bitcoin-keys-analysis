This file is to write down some [potentional] issues and things to do later. Just not to forget and to see where are we going. Deal with "TODO" first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: I have some doubts about the if statement, where all extractors run.. Wouldn't it be better, if extractors ran on a concrete input, rather than whole transaction? Does Python run all functions in if(), if result is already known??
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Implementation of parsing p2tr seems to be so easy, but I'm not shure about relevance of pubkeys, which would be gathered from this type of transactions, as they are in most cases <<tweaked>> :/ .
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Work around different sighash flags (now only [ALL], but SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY and others should be there as well).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Copy&paste in parsing serialized script. And in other parts of parse.py as well, but here that's the most critical.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Script can not parse P2SH and P2WSH transactions, where:
    1) OP_CHECKSIG or OP_CHECKMULTISIG are not at the end. Example (txid):
        208a95aff0c4243fdc7c610b700e1eb6a19bb786f3d96d79ecd410183f067687
        505a42d01dd26f002d5c1ba52debb15cc88f315740a239c70be996285ccccb6d
    2) Public key is before OP_ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG. Example (txid):
        9499b951301c14983d29b762539b22e3a2c1a59a196671172a27fe0e0a8e3bda
    3) And likely more..

Full rewrite of parsing serialized script is needed in order to solve it.
However, this is only a small percent of transactions, and this is not urgent, so I will try to deal with it later, if it turns out to be reasonable to do..
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO: Save pubkeys and txid only + <DONE> decomposite to a dedicated function? Something like "flush_to_file" seems to be a good idea for me.
+
<DONE> TODO: Revert similar size of gathered data files.
+
TODO: Change print_json.py so that it can go through multiple files.
