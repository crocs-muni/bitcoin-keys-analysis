This file is to write down some [potentional] issues and things to do later. Just not to forget and to see where are we going. Deal with "TODO" first.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: I have some doubts about the if statement, where all extractors run.. Wouldn't it be better, if extractors ran on a concrete input, rather than whole transaction?
NOTE2: Faster, because we run only one process_p2xxx function, but slower, because we have to look at the previous transaction vout.
NOTE3: Process_p2xxx() seems to return False on the very beggining, if that's not correct type of transaction, so maybe that's irrelevant?
NOTE4: But we'll collect more keys, as not all inputs of a transaction are of the same type.
NOTE5: Should I implement it and compare runtime?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IDEA: Tailor all the scripts so that analysis could run in real time (non-stop).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: In prepare_keys.py cut Schnorr keys to 16 bytes or less?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION: self.handle_checksig(transaction, vin, script) vs Parser.handle_checksig(self, transaction, vin, script) ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: I have doubts about extract_signature_p2pk(). Looking only at the first input seems to be not always right.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Work around different sighash flags (now only [ALL], but SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY and others should be there as well).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Review/rewrite handle_checksig() and handle_checkmultisig().
NOTE2: Script can not parse P2SH and P2WSH transactions, where:
    1) OP_CHECKSIG or OP_CHECKMULTISIG are not at the end. Example (txid):
        208a95aff0c4243fdc7c610b700e1eb6a19bb786f3d96d79ecd410183f067687
        505a42d01dd26f002d5c1ba52debb15cc88f315740a239c70be996285ccccb6d
    2) Public key is before OP_ENDIF OP_CHECKSIG. Example (txid):
        9499b951301c14983d29b762539b22e3a2c1a59a196671172a27fe0e0a8e3bda
    3) And likely more..

Full rewrite of parsing serialized script is needed in order to solve it.
However, this is only a small percent of transactions, and this is not urgent, so I will try to deal with it later, if it turns out to be reasonable to do..
